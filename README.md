# ðŸ§¬ find_homologs.sh

This repository contains a Bash script for identifying **homologous genes** using BLAST. The goal of this script is to search for **approximate matches** of a protein domain (such as a Histidine Kinase domain) in nucleotide sequences from other organismsâ€”useful in comparative genomics and functional inference.

## ðŸ“š Background

This project is based on an exercise to explore the utility of **sequence similarity searching** for identifying **homologous genes** in genome assemblies.

Specifically, we use a **protein query** sequence (e.g., Histidine Kinase domain from *E. coli* K-12) and BLAST it against a nucleotide subject assembly to identify potential homologs. BLAST is well-suited for such tasks due to its speed and sensitivity.

## ðŸ§ª Assignment Tasks

   - Create a script to:
     - Accept a **protein query file**
     - Accept a **nucleotide subject file**
     - Use the appropriate BLAST program (`tblastn`) to search protein queries against nucleotide subjects
     - Filter results to include only:
       - Sequence identity â‰¥ **30%**
       - Match length â‰¥ **90%** of the query sequence length
     - Output results to a specified output file
     - Print the number of valid matches to `stdout`

## ðŸ›  Usage

```bash
./find_homologs.sh <query_protein.faa> <subject_genome.fna> <output_file.txt>
